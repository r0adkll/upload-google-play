| whatsNewDirectory | The directory of localized "whats new" files to upload as the release notes. The files contained in the `whatsNewDirectory` MUST use the pattern `whatsnew-<LOCALE>` where `LOCALE` is using the [`BCP 47`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) format | A path to a valid `whatsNewDirectory` | false |

## Example usage

The below example publishes `MyApp` to Google Play, targetting 33% (`0.33`) of users with a priority of `2`.

```yaml
uses: r0adkll/upload-google-play@v1
with:
  serviceAccountJsonPlainText: ${{ SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON }}
  packageName: com.example.MyApp
  releaseFiles: app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
  track: production
  status: inProgress
  inAppUpdatePriority: 2
  userFraction: 0.33
  whatsNewDirectory: distribution/whatsnew
  mappingFile: app/build/outputs/mapping/release/mapping.txt
```

The `whatsNewDirectory` in this example supplies changelogs for English, German and Japanese

```
distribution/
└─ whatsnew/
  ├─ whatsnew-en-US
  ├─ whatsnew-de-DE
  └─ whatsnew-ja-JP
```
